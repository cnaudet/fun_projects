# fun_projects

This is a collection of past projects that I've used just for fun. 

It includes:
- a lie group solver written in julia that is capable of taking (specific) simple PDE's and finding is lie algebra.
- an english-persian translation word list where the words are generated using chatGPT. The word list is simply the translation pair, but it is converted to a csv so that it can be directly read into anki
- An optimization problem (written assuming you are using Google Colab) that can take any number of teams (for say a basketball tournament) and split them into groups (size of your choosing) and schedule games for them where the schedule is governed by constraints such as, must play onnly teams in your group and only play them exactly one time. The optimization problem has a set of times and set of courts that it must also ensure are not being used at the same time. Overall, this is a simple seeming, but complex optimization problem that is solved using this code.
